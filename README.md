# NLP-assignment-Seinfeld-or-Friends-
NLP (Natural Language Processing) project - Shows classification : Seinfeld or Friends.

Having a dataset containing the scripts of all Seinfeld and Friends episodes,
Our goal is to create a deep learning model that could identify whether a line was taken from a Seinfeld episode or a Friends episode.

There are 5 columns in the dataset: Dialogue, Character, Episode, Show, and Dialogue_length.
While we use all of them for EDA and pre-processing, but we only use 'Dialogue' and 'Show' during training an testing the model. 

After testing our DL model on the test set, we will explore our results for each character in each show.
